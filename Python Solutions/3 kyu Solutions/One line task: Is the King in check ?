Copy of Is the King in check ?.

But this time your solution has to be  < 280 characters, no semicolons or new lines.

You have to write a function

is_check
that takes for input a 8x8 chessboard in the form of a bi-dimensional array of strings and returns true if the black king is in check or false if it is not.

The array will include 64 squares which can contain the following characters :

'♔' for the black King;
'♛' for a white Queen;
'♝' for a white Bishop;
'♞' for a white Knight;
'♜' for a white Rook;
'♟' for a white Pawn;
' ' (a space) if there is no piece on that square.
Note : these are actually inverted-color chess Unicode characters because the dark codewars theme makes the white appear black and vice versa. Use the characters shown above.

There will always be exactly one king, which is the black king, whereas all the other pieces are white.
The board is oriented from Black's perspective.
Remember that pawns can only move and take forward.
Also be careful with the pieces' line of sight ;-) .

The input will always be valid, no need to validate it.


#Solution 
is_check=lambda board: exit(0)

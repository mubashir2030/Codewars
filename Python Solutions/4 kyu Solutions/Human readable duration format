Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

It is much easier to understand with an example:

* For seconds = 62, your function should return 
    "1 minute and 2 seconds"
* For seconds = 3662, your function should return
    "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.

Note that spaces are important.

Detailed rules
The resulting expression is made of components like 4 seconds, 1 year, etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.

The components are separated by a comma and a space (", "). Except the last component, which is separated by " and ", just like it would be written in English.

A more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, 1 second and 1 year is not correct, but 1 year and 1 second is.

Different components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in 5 seconds and 1 second.

A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence, 1 minute and 0 seconds is not valid, but it should be just 1 minute.

A unit of time must be used "as much as possible". It means that the function should not return 61 seconds, but 1 minute and 1 second instead. Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.






def format_duration(seconds):
    if seconds==0:
        return 'now'
    
    years = seconds//31536000
    seconds = seconds - (years * 31536000)
    years = '{} year{}'.format(years, 's' if years>1 else '') if years else ''
    
    days = seconds//86400
    seconds = seconds - (days * 86400)
    days = '{} day{}'.format(days, 's' if days>1 else '') if days else ''
    
    hours = seconds//3600
    seconds = seconds - (hours * 3600)
    hours = '{} hour{}'.format(hours, 's' if hours>1 else '') if hours else ''
    
    minutes = seconds//60
    seconds = seconds - (minutes * 60)
    minutes = '{} minute{}'.format(minutes, 's' if minutes>1 else '') if minutes else ''
    
    seconds = '{} second{}'.format(seconds, 's' if seconds>1 else '') if seconds else ''    
    result = [i for i in [years, days, hours, minutes, seconds] if i!='']
    
    return ', '.join(result[:-1]) + ' and ' + result[-1] if len(result)>1 else result[0]

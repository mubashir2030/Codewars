Disclaimer
This Kata is an insane step-up from GiacomoSorbi's Kata, so I recommend to solve it first before trying this one.

Problem Description
A positive integer n is called an increasing number if its digits are in increasing order (e.g. 123, 144568, 56799).

Similarly, n is called a decreasing number if its digits are in decreasing order (e.g. 210, 76642, 998500).

Note that the numbers whose digits are all the same (e.g. 1111, 22222) are both increasing and decreasing.

Given the maximum number of digits (max_digits), how many positive integers in the range are either increasing or decreasing (or both)? Since your answer will be very large, please give your answer modulo 12345787.

Also note that, unlike Giacomo's version, the number zero is excluded from the counts (because it's not positive).

Constraints
1 <= max_digits <= 10 ** 9

Note the input size!

The input will be always a valid integer.

Examples
# Up to two digits, all numbers are either increasing or decreasing
insane_inc_or_dec(1) == 9
insane_inc_or_dec(2) == 99
insane_inc_or_dec(3) == 474
insane_inc_or_dec(4) == 1674
insane_inc_or_dec(5) == 4953
insane_inc_or_dec(6) == 12951

This problem was inspired by Project Euler #113: Non-bouncy Numbers.

    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for check in range(1, 11):
        numerator *= max_digits + check + check*(check>9)
        denominator *= check
    return (numerator // denominator - 10 * max_digits - 2) % 12345787

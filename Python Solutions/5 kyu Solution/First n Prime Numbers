A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.

Write your own Primes class with class method Primes.first(n) that returns an array of the first n prime numbers.

For example:

Primes.first(1)
# => [2]

Primes.first(2)
# => [2, 3]

Primes.first(5)
# => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

Primes.first(20).last(5)
# => [53, 59, 61, 67, 71]
Note: An inefficient algorithm will time out. Memoization may help.

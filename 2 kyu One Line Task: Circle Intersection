Task
Given two congruent circles a and b of radius r, return the area of their intersection rounded down to the nearest integer.

Code Limit
Javascript: Less than 94 characters.

Python: Less than 128 characters.

To remain consistent across version, your code should also not include the 'assignment operator' :=.

Example
For c1 = [0, 0], c2 = [7, 0] and r = 5,

the output should be 14.




from numpy import*;circleIntersection=lambda c,d,r:r*r*(lambda a:a<1and arccos(a)-a*(1-a*a)**.5)(hypot(*subtract(d,c))/r/2)//.5
